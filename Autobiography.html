                    Dear HR Manager,
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    I am Chiu Yu-Wei, with 8 years of relevant experience as a Software Developer. I come from Taiwan and will enter Canada on a working holiday visa from May 19, 2024. I attended Delta 2024 NPI conference last week and was very interested in hearing your team's report, so I am writing this letter to express my interest in the software developer position. I consider I have the skills and experience required for this position.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    As a software engineer, I have expert-level proficiency in Java, vue.js, and Python. I also have a long-term experience in e-commerce service. Besides, with more and more experience, I have become a senior engineer leading new colleagues. For them to develop smoothly, I will write system design documents so that they can read them. Therefore, I think I could bring my experience and knowledge to your company. I also get the best employee award in Delta this year.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Given my background in software engineering and e-commerce experience, I am a particularly good fit for the position at your firm. 
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter and I look forward to hearing from you about this job. </p>
                <br>
