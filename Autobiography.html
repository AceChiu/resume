                <p>I am Chiu Yu-Wei. I have worked in the office of the WT microelectronics Co., Ltd. since 2016. I am the MIS Engineer in Architecture Department. I am responsible for Back-End java development for B2B data exchange via Rosettanet/EDI protocol. I have handled on many B2B transaction for venders and customers, such as Broadcom, NXP, Asus, and Quanta. To elaborate, I implement new B2B transaction service in new system and conduct code refactoring for inefficient and cluttered codes in old systems. I used to spend time and effort on modifying when the business transaction was changed in old systems. As a result, I provide some web services to let our users modify by themselves. Successfully, I save time on maintaining significantly. That is to say, I increase efficiency for the company. In addition, I designed and built ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) system by SAP Data service. The system extracts the data used in Business Intelligence. This innovative system indeed benefits my company.

I use node.js, d3js and express framework to develop a quantitative analysis program which alerts users about irregular movements with regard to Taiwan's Stock Market. Third,
