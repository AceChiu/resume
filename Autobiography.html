                <p> 
                    I am Chiu Yu-Wei, with 8 years of relevant experience as a software developer and expert-level proficiency in Java, vue.js, and Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was a senior full-stack software engineer at Delta Electrics. 
                    My main roles included building Factory and logistics-related systems. 
                    I also established system architecture to help junior co-workers complete their work. 
                    On the other hand, assist in sharing services and libraries within the development team, for example, schedule service, mail service, authentication service, and GitLab pipeline CICD.
                </p>
                <p>  
                    I also have a long-term experience in microservices. 
                    For my important project, I built an e-commerce service system that used microservice architecture. 
                    Those services include user accounts, quotations, purchases, consignments, invoices, forecasts, shipments, and reports. 
                    There are eight main microservices and each corresponding component handles the business logic for their responsibility. 
                    The system also has multiple redundant copies of the services, so there is no central point of failure for a service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is worth mentioning that after five years of hard work at Delta, I received the Best Employee Award this year, which proves that I am a trustworthy employee. 
                    I get along well with co-workers and supervisors, and I will help customers solve problems well.
                 </p>
                <p>    
                    Thank you for taking the time to read my resume and autobiography and I look forward to hearing from you about this job.
