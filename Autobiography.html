                    Dear HR Manager,
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    I am Chiu Yu-Wei, with 8 years of relevant experience as a Software Developer. I come from Taiwan and will enter Canada on a working holiday visa from May 19, 2024. I attended Delta 2024 NPI conference last week and was very interested in hearing your team's report, so I am writing this letter to express my interest in the software developer position. I consider I have the skills and experience required for this position.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    As a software engineer, I have expert-level proficiency in Java, vue.js, and Python. I also have a long-term experience in microservices. In Delta, we build an e-commerce service system that is a microservice architecture. It services that correspond to business features, like user accounts, quotations, purchases, consignment, invoices, forecasts, shipments, and reports. There are eight main microservices and each corresponding component handles the business logic for that responsibility. The system will then have multiple redundant copies of the services so that there is no central point of failure for a service.    
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Besides, with more and more experience, I have become a senior engineer leading new colleagues. For them to develop smoothly, I will write system design documents so that they can read them. Therefore, I think I could bring my experience and knowledge to your company. I also got the best employee award in Delta this year.    
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Finally, I also have some knowledge about financial services, because I have continued to pay attention to a series of innovative developments in cryptocurrency finance three or four years ago. Most Defi projects copy services of traditional financial models
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter and I look forward to hearing from you about this job. </p>
                <br>
