Specially, at fourth year of college, I climbed Yushan National Park with Mountain Club. Itâ€™s an impressive experience with so much to feel the beauty of nature, and learn to how to complete the difficult task with your partners. In the trip, we have a lot of problems like one of us was altitude sickness, get lost, and someone hurt himself foot. How to solve problem in case of any emergency is a good experiment.
